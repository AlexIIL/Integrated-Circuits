Integrated-Circuits
===================

A mod that allows you to create integrated circuits by combining logic gates.
The use of Project:Red is recommended for bundled wires, not a requirement anymore.

Localization
------------

You can always do a pull request for a new language or update an individual langauge file. I will validate any change with a translator, so don't try anything silly. If you find any grammar/spelling mistakes for the English localization, please contact me rather than creating a pull request. For small changes that are only one or two lines, the same applies. You can find me on [#obsidian@esper.net](irc://irc.esper.net:6666/obsidian) (Vic).
